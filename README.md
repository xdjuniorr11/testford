The maven project
This project was created with the purpose of creating a converter from decimal numbers to Roman numerals.
The convertidorRomano  method was implemented to make said implementation where a unit of Roman numerals were mapped into units, tens, hundreds and thousands,
From there, through the remainder, we were able to know what unit the number we wanted to convert belonged to.

Finally, convertidorRomano  is called in the Method along with the number that was entered through the console,
In addition, a while loop was enclosed and conditioned to 0 to be able to exit the loop.
